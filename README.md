# GFFJ: Gap Finding and Filling in Julia
An implementation of [Gap Finding & Filling](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2105-8-212) in Julia. 

## Requirement
In order to use SEML, the user needs to [install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html) first. This version is compatible with [Julia v1.1.0](https://julialang.org/downloads/index.html).

[Gurobi.jl](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Gurobi.jl) is used in GFFJ as the default solver for both gap finding and filling. [Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) provides free academic license for non-commercial use. 
Users can also choose to use [GLPK](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/GLPK.jl) or [CPLEX](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/CPLEX.jl) for gap finding. GLPK is free for all users, while CPLEX provides free academic license. But note that comparing to Gurobi and CPLEX, it takes GLPK much more time and memory to solve the same problem. 

For gap filling, Gurobi is set as the only solver since it works way better than the other two in our tests. 

## Usage
Within [Julia](http://http://julialang.org), press __]__ to enter __pkg>__ mode. 
To install GFFJ, issue 

```
add https://github.com/varnerlab/Julia_GapFill_Repository.git
```
To test the GFFJ installation use:

```
test GFFJ 
```
which runs two test examples from the __test__ directory. Lastly, to delete the JuPOETs package use the command:

```
rm GFFJ
```

To use GFFJ in your project simply issue the command:

```
using GFFJ
```






Two interfaces are provided, "__find_gaps()__" and "__fill_gaps_min()__". 

The "__find_gaps()__" interface:
Argument | Required | Description | Options | Default
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
in_path | Yes | path to input file | | none
out_path | No	| path to where files are written | | ./autogeneratedmodel
host | No	| host type  | bacterial \| mammalian | bacterial
model | No | model type | FBA \| FVA \| Kinetics \| rFBA | Kinetics
lang | No | programming language | julia \| python \| python2 \| python3 \| matlab | julia
